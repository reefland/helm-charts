# Helm charts overview

While you can use these charts directly, they are not intended to be used directly.  These charts are not updated for per application version.

NOTE: These charts are used as templates for an ArgoCD Application deployment.  The ArgoCD deployment maintains the hints needed for RenovateBot to update application image versions (see application *Link* for details)
